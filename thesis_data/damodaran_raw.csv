Country Risk Premiums,,,,,,,,
"To estimate the equity risk premium for a country, I start with a mature market premium and add an additional country risk premium, based upon the risk of the country in question.",,,,,,,,
"Use the look up table in the next worksheet, to look up the statistics for an individual country or region.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Step 1: Estimating mature market risk premium,,,,,,,,
"To estimate the mature market risk premium, I start with the implied equity risk premium for the S&P 500. To see the latest estimate for this number, go to my website and you can download the excel spreadsheet containing the implied premium",,,,,,,,

Historical monthly ERP:,https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/implprem/ERPbymonth.xls,,,,,,,
"Until the January 2025 update, I used the S&P's equity risk premium as the mature market premium, drawing on the Moody's Aaa rating for the United States.",,,,,,,,
"On May 16, 2025, Moody's downgraded the US from Aaa to Aa1. To get the mature market premium, I now subtract the US's country risk premium (based on its rating and the relative equity market volatility) from the S&P's eRP",,,,,,,,
Mature market premium = ERP for the S&P 500 minus (Default spread for US sovereign rating × Relative Equity Volatility),,,,,,,,
"In January 2026, for  example, when the implied ERP for the S&P 500 was 4.59% (over the adjusted dollar riskfree rate), the US had a rating of Aa1 and the default spread for that rating was 0.23% and the relative equity market volatility was 1.52",,,,,,,,
Mature market premium = 4.61% - (0.23% × 1.52) = 4.23%,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Step 2: Estimate the default spread for the country in question. I offer two choices, one based upon the local currency sovereign rating for the country from Moody's and the other is the CDS spread for the country (if one exists)",,,,,,,,
Moody's ratings:,http://www.moodys.com,,"(You will have to register, but it is free. Look under sovereign ratings)",,,,,
Ratings to spreads:,"Based upon my estimates of typical spreads for each ratings class. I compute these by averaging CDS spreads and sovereign US$ bond spreads by ratings class, at the start of every year.",,,,,,,
CDS spreads:,Bloomberg,,,,,,,
"If you cannot find a country on this list, it is because that country does not have a sovereign rating or a sovereign CDS spread. Try the PRS worksheet in this spreadsheet for an alternate estimate.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Step 3: Convert the default spread into a country risk premium,,,,,,,,
"With sovereign ratings default spreads, you have two choices:",,,,,,,,
"Choice 1: Use the default spread as the measure of the additional country risk premium. To make this choice, go into the ERP worksheet and set cell E5 to 1.00.",,,,,,,,
"Choice 2: Scale the default spread up to reflect the higher risk of equity in the market, relative to the default spread. I used the ratio of the S&P Emerging Market Equity Index std deviation to the iShares Emerging Market Bond Index standard deviation",,,,,,,,
"With CDS spreads, I compute the base number in two steps",,,,,,,,
"Substep 1: Since the base equity premium is for a mature market (assumed to be default free), I net out the CDS spread for Switzerland (the lowest sovereign CDS) from each country's CDS to get a net spread.",,,,,,,,
"Substep 2: I apply the scaling factor that you chose for the default spreads to this number to get a country risk premium. The default scaling is set at the my most recent year's estimate, but you can change it to 1, if you would",,,,,,,,
prefer not to scale the default spread.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Step 4: Compute a total equity risk premium,,,,,,,,
Add the mature market premium from step 1 to the country risk premium from step 3 to get a total equity risk premium.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Step 5: Compute regional averages and regional weighted averages,,,,,,,,
"For the regional averages, I use a simple average of the total and country risk premiums by region",,,,,,,,
"For the weighted averages, I use the World Bank GDP estimates from the most recent year. ",,,,,,,,
