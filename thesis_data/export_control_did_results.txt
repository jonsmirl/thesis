[14:11:42] ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS (post-treatment identification)
[14:11:42] ======================================================================
[14:11:42]   Since most constrained (Chinese) firms only began publishing on
[14:11:42]   HuggingFace after the Oct 2022 export controls, standard DID is
[14:11:42]   not well-identified. We use three alternative approaches:
[14:11:42] 
  (A) Post-Treatment Cross-Sectional Comparison
[14:11:42]   --------------------------------------------------
[14:11:42]     Spec A1: edge_share ~ constrained + quarter_FE
[14:11:42]       beta(constrained) = -0.1140 (SE=0.0570)**
[14:11:42]       p = 0.0456, N = 151, R^2 = 0.0974
[14:11:42]       Interpretation: Constrained firms have -11.4% lower
[14:11:42]         edge share than controls in the same quarter (post-treatment)
[14:11:42] 
  (B) Post-Treatment Time-Trend Interaction
[14:11:42]   --------------------------------------------------
[14:11:42]     Spec B1: edge_share ~ constrained + time_idx + constrained*time_idx
[14:11:42]       const                      +0.4476 (SE=0.0856)  p=0.0000  ***
[14:11:42]       constrained                -0.1032 (SE=0.1185)  p=0.3837  
[14:11:42]       time_idx                   +0.0031 (SE=0.0119)  p=0.7921  
[14:11:42]       constrained_x_time         +0.0014 (SE=0.0156)  p=0.9263  
[14:11:42]     N = 151, R^2 = 0.0184
[14:11:42]     Interpretation: Constrained firms' edge share INCREASES
[14:11:42]       +0.0014 faster per quarter than controls
[14:11:42]     Spec B2: edge_share ~ time_idx + constrained*time_idx + firm_FE
[14:11:42]       beta(constrained*time) = +0.0089 (SE=0.0122)
[14:11:42]       p = 0.4641, N = 151, R^2 = 0.4934
[14:11:42] 
  (C) Model-Level Edge-Compatible Probability
[14:11:42]   --------------------------------------------------
[14:11:42]     Spec C1 (LPM): P(edge) ~ constrained + months_since_entry + quarter_FE
[14:11:42]       beta(constrained)       = -0.0783 (SE=0.0279)***  p=0.0050
[14:11:42]       beta(months_since_entry) = -0.0054
[14:11:42]       N = 2984, R^2 = 0.0835
[14:11:42]       Interpretation: Being a constrained firm decreases
[14:11:42]         the probability of releasing an edge-compatible model by 7.8%
[14:11:42]     Spec C2: n_edge ~ constrained + time_idx + constrained*time_idx
[14:11:42]       beta(constrained*time) = +0.4993 (SE=0.4676)
[14:11:42]       p = 0.2856, N = 151, R^2 = 0.0242
[14:11:42]     Spec C3: log_downloads ~ constrained + time_idx + constrained*time_idx
[14:11:42]       beta(constrained*time) = +0.3758 (SE=0.1734)**
[14:11:42]       p = 0.0302, N = 151, R^2 = 0.0453

  CAVEATS:
[14:11:43]     - HuggingFace is not the complete universe of AI models (some
[14:11:43]       Chinese models may be on domestic platforms).
[14:11:43]     - Edge-compatibility classification is approximate (based on
[14:11:43]       parameter count extracted from model names).
[14:11:43]     - Both groups may shift to edge models for independent reasons
[14:11:43]       (e.g., consumer demand, mobile deployment trends).
[14:11:43] 
  Connection to thesis mechanism:
[14:11:43]     Paper 1 (Prop. 1): N firms overinvest by factor ~N/(N-1), accelerating
[14:11:43]     learning curves. Export controls create exogenous variation in hardware
[14:11:43]     access, separating the overinvestment/learning channel from standard
[14:11:43]     Arrow learning-by-doing. If constrained firms produce more edge-compatible
[14:11:43]     models, this confirms that the LEARNING EXTERNALITY (not just cost
[14:11:43]     reduction) drives the transition to distributed architecture.
