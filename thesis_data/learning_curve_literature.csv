Semiconductor,"DRAM (7 generations, IV)",0.3200,0.0500,,1974-1992,Irwin & Klenow (1994) JPE 102(6),IV (firm-level panel),Learning rate ~20%. IV corrects simultaneous equations bias. Canonical cite.
Semiconductor,Microprocessors/SoC (firm-node),0.0500,,,2004-2015,Goldberg et al. (2024) NBER WP 32651,"Structural model, proprietary",Learning rate ~3.4% at firm-technology node. Much lower than industry lore.
Semiconductor,Microprocessors/SoC (w/ within-firm),0.0700,,,2004-2015,Goldberg et al. (2024) NBER WP 32651,"Structural model, proprietary",Learning rate ~4.7% allowing within-firm spillovers across nodes.
Semiconductor,Microprocessors/SoC (w/ cross-border),0.1200,,,2004-2015,Goldberg et al. (2024) NBER WP 32651,"Structural model, proprietary",Learning rate ~8% with cross-country spillovers. Spillovers via fabless clients.
Semiconductor,"DRAM (aggregate, OLS)",0.7700,0.0400,41.0000,1984-2024,"This paper, pooled OLS",OLS (aggregate annual),"INFLATED by: (a) simultaneous equations bias, (b) measurement error in early cumulative production. Chow tests reject stability at all breakpoints (F=4.2-41.1). Not used as baseline."
Semiconductor,DRAM (early subsample),0.3800,,12.0000,1984-1995,"This paper, subsample OLS",OLS (subsample),Plausible — close to Irwin & Klenow IV estimate.
Semiconductor,DRAM (late subsample),0.3100,,14.0000,2011-2024,"This paper, subsample OLS",OLS (subsample),Plausible — consistent with mature industry.
Semiconductor,DRAM (middle subsample),0.8500,,15.0000,1996-2010,"This paper, subsample OLS",OLS (subsample),Implausibly high — likely driven by measurement error in cumulative production estimates.
